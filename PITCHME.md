## Fun fact!
There is a Shakespeare Programming Language: http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/

*A programming language created with the design goal to make the source code resemble Shakespeare plays.*

*The characters in the play are variables. If you want to assign a character, let's say Hamlet, a negative value, you put him and another character on the stage and let that character insult Hamlet.*
